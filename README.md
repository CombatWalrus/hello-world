# hello-world
# The first of (hopefully many!) repositories to come.

Hello there! I'm Sam and I'm hopefully going to be studying Computer Science for my first year at University.
I have some very limited experience with programming, having used HTML, Python, Haskell and Visual Basic to varying degrees for random projects.

I'm currently following the tutorial for Github, since it all seems foreign and scary to me currently. Wish me luck!
